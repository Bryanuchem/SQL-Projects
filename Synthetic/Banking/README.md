# Banking SQL Analysis

## 📌 Overview  
This project uses a synthetic banking dataset to analyze customer transactions, account balances, and loan activities. The goal was to simulate real-world banking queries such as customer segmentation, transaction trends, and loan repayment analysis.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Name: Banking Dataset (Synthetic)  
- Source: Artificially generated for portfolio use  
- Description: Contains tables for customers, accounts, transactions, and loans.  

## ❓ Questions  
The list of analysis questions can be found in [`questions.txt`](./questions.txt).  

## 💡 Solutions  
All SQL queries answering the questions are in [`solutions.sql`](./solutions.sql).  

## 🔑 Skills Demonstrated  
- JOINs across multiple tables (customers, accounts, loans)  
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)  
- Subqueries for customer segmentation  
- Window functions for ranking top customers  
- Case statements for loan status classification  

## 📊 Example Insights  
- Top 10% of customers held 60% of total deposits.  
- Loan default rates were highest among customers under 30.  
- Customers with 3+ accounts had the lowest churn risk.  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. View questions in `questions.txt`.  
2. Run `solutions.sql` in your SQL environment.  
3. Compare outputs and insights.
